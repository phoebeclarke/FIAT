# FIAT

This is the project I worked on during my internship with the Met Office.

FIAT stands for "**Forecast Intervention and Analysis Tool**" - an inhouse tool use to compare weather forecasts to weather observations.
The forecasts are created using various data models, such as the Euro4 and UKV.

As it stands there are no available forecasts or observations, as the images themselves fall under the Data Protection act.
